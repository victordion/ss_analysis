# Shadowsocks Statistics
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/victordion/ss_analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victordion/ss_analysis)

This is a python script for analyzing log generated by shadowsocks. It lets you know where the traffic is going.

## Installation
No installation is needed. Just run everything from the project directory.

## Usage
The log file is usually located at `/var/log/shadowsocks.log` on the machine where the server is running. For analysis, you must obtain a copy and put it under your working directory.

A few examples on how to use the script:

Get server time based analysis with resolution of hour(-g h) in verbose mode (-v)

    python analyze.py get_stats_by_time -g h -v

Get server time based analysis with resolution of day(-g D) in verbose mode (-v)

    python analyze.py get_stats_by_time -g D -v

Find out what domain names are more closely related in time. This will produce a pdf file in the same directory.

    python similarity_analyze.py

Get overview of client connection activities.

    python analyze.py show_ips

Find client IP based statistics, wildcard is supported.
    
    python analyze.py get_stats_by_ip --client_ip *.*.*.*
    

For more information, run
    
    python analyze.py -h
